# Laplacian filters benchmark

This project aims to compare the performance of different implementations of the Laplacian filter (edge detection).

## DataSet

The [test pictures](./pictures/) were been taken from the [BSDS500 dataset](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/). 

We used the grayscale versions and converted them into [_portable graymap format_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) (.pgm) to keep the implementation simple, including with languages such as mojo where there is no utility library yet.

Some scripts use the [inline image protocol](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html) offered by iTerm2 to make the user experience more interactive. This also helped us during the development phase to quickly detect implementation errors. 

An extract of the dataset can be viewed using the ```viewpic.py```  or ```viewpic.mojo``` scripts.

## Installation

### Python

Python implementations have been tested with version 3.11.1. You can install the dependancies with pip
```sh
cd python; pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Mojo

‚ö†Ô∏è Mojo implementations have been tested with the pre-release of mojo version 0.7.0. You can follow [the instructions](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started/) to install mojo compiler on Ubuntu linux or MacOs. There is no external dependancies.

## How to run the benchmark

### Interactive mode

It is possible to interactively test each implementation, for example:

```sh
cd python; python naive.py
```

Likewise, it is possible to test interactively mojo implementations :

```sh
cd mojo; mojo naive.mojo
```

### Benchmark mode

Interactive mode works on a subset of the dataset and the display of images can influence the results. The run.sh script is used to launch the battery of tests sequentially :

```sh
./run.sh
```
