# Laplacian filters benchmark

This project aims to compare the performance of different implementations of the Laplacian filter (edge detection).

## DataSet

The [test pictures](./pictures/) are from the [BSDS500 dataset](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/). 

We used the grayscale versions and converted them into [_portable graymap format_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) (.pgm) to keep the implementation simple, including with languages such as Mojo üî• where there is no utility libraries yet.

Some scripts use the [inline image protocol](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html) offered by iTerm2 to make the user experience more interactive. This also helped us during the development phase to quickly detect implementation errors. 

A subset of the dataset can be viewed using the ```viewpic.py```  or ```viewpic.mojo``` scripts.

## Installation

### Python

Python implementations have been tested with version 3.11.1. You can install the dependancies with pip
```sh
cd python; pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Mojo üî•

‚ö†Ô∏è The Mojo implementations have been tested with the pre-release of mojo version 24.1. Mojo is moving [fast](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/changelog.html) : you may encounter malfunctions if you try to use it with a newer version. I plan to follow up quickly the syntax updates.

You can follow [the instructions](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started/) to install mojo compiler on Ubuntu linux or MacOs. There is no external dependancies.

## How to run the benchmark

### Interactive mode

It is possible to interactively test each implementation, for example:

```sh
cd python; python naive.py
```

Likewise, it is possible to test interactively mojo implementations :

```sh
cd mojo; mojo naive.mojo
```

### Benchmark mode

Interactive mode works on a subset of the dataset and the display of images may influence the results. The script `run.sh` allows you to run the battery of tests in batch mode on all the dataset (except the first 3 slowest python implementations) :

```sh
./run.sh
```
